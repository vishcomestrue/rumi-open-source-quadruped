## Performance Graph

![Performance Graph](https://emanual.robotis.com/assets/images/dxl/mx/mx-64_ntgraph.jpg)

**NOTE**: The given Stall torque rating for a servo is different from its continuous output rating, and may also differ from its expected real world performance.

Stall torque is the maximum momentary torque output the servo is capable of, and is generally how RC servos are measured. The Performance graph, or N-T curve, from the above graph is measured under conditions simulating a gradually increasing load.

Generally, the Maximum Torque shown through Performance Graph testing is less than the maximum Stall Torque.

The actual real world performance of the servo will generally be closer to the performance graph measurements, not the rated stall torque.

### Power Supply Caution

**CAUTION - When supplying power:**

- It is recommended to use a ROBOTIS controller or SMPS2DYNAMIXEL power adapter.
- Do not connect or disconnect DYNAMIXEL actuator cables while power is being supplied.

# Control Table

The Control Table is a data structure used by DYNAMIXEL actuators to manage the state of the device. Users can read data registers to get information about the status of the device with Read Instruction Packets, and modify data registers to control the device with Write Instruction Packets.

**CAUTION**
1. MX(2.0) Firmware is different from MX series' control table and address. Please check the control table address before usage.
2. MX(2.0) Firmware inherits DYNAMIXEL-X function. Therefore, it supports DYNAMIXEL Protocol 1.0 and DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0, and various Operating Modes, Secondary ID, Drive Mode, Bus Watchdog, etc. Please refer to the control table for more details.

## Control Table Structure

The Control Table is a structure that consists of multiple Data fields to store status or to control the device. Users can check current status of the device by reading a specific Data from the Control Table with Read Instruction Packets. WRITE Instruction Packets enable users to control the device by changing specific Data in the Control Table. The Address is a unique value when accessing a specific Data in the Control Table with Instruction Packets.

**NOTE**: Two's complement is applied for the negative value.

### Area (EEPROM, RAM)

The Control Table is divided into 2 Areas. Data in the RAM Area is reset to initial values when the power is reset(Volatile). On the other hand, data in the EEPROM Area is maintained even when the device is powered off(Non-Volatile).

**Data in the EEPROM Area can only be written to if Torque Enable(64) is cleared to '0'(Torque OFF).**

### Size

The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet. For data larger than 2 bytes will be saved according to Little Endian.

### Access

The Control Table has two different access properties. 'RW' property stands for read and write access permission while 'R' stands for read only access permission. Data with the read only property cannot be changed by the WRITE Instruction. Read only property('R') is generally used for measuring and monitoring purpose, and read write property('RW') is used for controlling device.

### Initial Value

Each data in the Control Table is restored to initial values when the device is turned on. Default values in the EEPROM area are initial values of the device (factory default settings). If any values in the EEPROM area are modified by a user, modified values will be restored as initial values when the device is turned on. Initial Values in the RAM area are restored when the device is turned on.

**CAUTION**: Protocol 1.0 does not support addresses greater than 256. Therefore, Indirect Address 29 ~ 56 and Indirect Data 29 ~ 56 can only be accessed with Protocol 2.0.

# Control Table Description

**CAUTION**: Data in the EEPROM Area can only be written when the value of Torque Enable(64) is cleared to '0'.

## Model Number(0)

This address stores model number of DYNAMIXEL.

## Firmware Version(6)

This address stores firmware version of DYNAMIXEL.

## ID(7)

The ID is a unique value in the network to identify each DYNAMIXEL with an Instruction Packet.
0~252 (0xFC) values can be used as an ID, and 254(0xFE) is occupied as a broadcast ID. The Broadcast ID(254, 0xFE) can send an Instruction Packet to all connected DYNAMIXEL simultaneously.

**NOTE**: Please avoid using an identical ID for multiple DYNAMIXEL. You may face communication failure or may not be able to detect DYNAMIXEL with an identical ID.

**NOTE**: If the Instruction Packet ID is set to the Broadcast ID(0xFE), Status Packets will not be returned for READ or WRITE Instructions regardless of the set value of Status Return Level (68).

## Baud Rate(8)

The Baud Rate(8) determines serial communication speed between a controller and DYNAMIXEL.

| Value | Baud Rate | Margin of Error |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 7 | 4.5M [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 6 | 4M [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 5 | 3M [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 4 | 2M [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 3 | 1M [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 2 | 115,200 [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 1(Default) | 57,600 [bps] | 0.000 [%] |
| 0 | 9,600 [bps] | 0.000 [%] |

**NOTE**: Less than 3% of the baud rate error margin will not affect UART communication.

**NOTE**: For stable communication with higher Baudrate using U2D2, configure USB Latency value to the lower.

## Return Delay Time(9)

If the DYNAMIXEL receives an Instruction Packet, it will return the Status Packet after the time of the set Return Delay Time(9).
Note that the range of values is 0 to 254 (0XFE) and its unit is 2 [μsec]. For instance, if the Return Delay Time(9) is set to '10', the Status Packet will be returned after 20[μsec] when the Instruction Packet is received.

| Unit | Value Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 2[μsec] | 0 ~ 254 | Default value '250'(500[μsec]) <br/> Maximum value: '508'[μsec] |

## Drive Mode(10)

The Drive Mode(10) configures Drive Mode of DYNAMIXEL.

| Bit | Item | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Bit 7(0x80) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 6(0x40) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 5(0x20) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 4(0x10) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 3(0x08) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 2(0x04) | Profile Configuration | **[0]** Velocity-based Profile: Create a Profile based on Velocity<br/>**[1]** Time-based Profile: Create Profile based on time |
| Bit 1(0x02) | - | Unused, always '0' |
| Bit 0(0x01) | Normal/Reverse Mode | **[0]** Normal Mode: CCW(Positive), CW(Negative)<br/>**[1]** Reverse Mode: CCW(Negative), CW(Positive) |

**NOTE**: Time-based Profile is available from **firmware V42**.

**NOTE**: If the value of Bit 0(Normal/Reverse Mode) of the Drive Mode(10) is set to `1`, rotational direction is inverted.
Thus, **Position**, **Velocity**, **Current**, **PWM** will have an inverted direction.
This feature can be very useful when configuring symmetrical joint.

## Operating Mode(11)

| Value | Operating Mode | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Current Control Mode | DYNAMIXEL only controls current(torque) regardless of speed and position. This mode is ideal for a gripper or a system that only uses current(torque) control or a system that has additional velocity/position controllers. |
| 1 | Velocity Control Mode | This mode controls velocity. This mode is identical to the Wheel Mode(endless) from existing DYNAMIXEL. This mode is ideal for wheel-type robots. |
| 3(Default) | Position Control Mode | This mode controls position. This mode is identical to the Joint Mode from existing DYNAMIXEL. Operating position range is limited by the Max Position Limit(48) and the Min Position Limit(52). This mode is ideal for articulated robots that each joint rotates less than 360 degrees. |
| 4 | Extended Position Control Mode(Multi-turn) | This mode controls position. This mode is identical to the Multi-turn Position Control from existing DYNAMIXEL. 512 turns are supported(-256[rev] ~ 256[rev]). This mode is ideal for multi-turn wrists or conveyer systems or a system that requires an additional reduction gear. Note that Max Position Limit(48), Min Position Limit(52) are not used on Extended Position Control Mode. |
| 5 | Current-based Position Control Mode | This mode controls both position and current(torque). Up to 512 turns are supported(-256[rev] ~ 256[rev]). This mode is ideal for a system that requires both position and current control such as articulated robots or grippers. |
| 16 | PWM Control Mode (Voltage Control Mode) | This mode directly controls PWM output. (Voltage Control Mode) |

**NOTE**: When the Operating Mode(11) switches to another mode, value of Gains, such as Velocity PI(76, 78); Position PID(80, 82, 84); Feedforward(88, 90), will be reset fitting to a selected Operating Mode(11). Beside, the profile generator and the data of determining the limit value will be reset either. See the next description for more details.

1. The Profile Velocity(112), Profile Acceleration(108): Reset to '0'
2. The Goal PWM(100) and Goal Current(102) are reset to the value of PWM Limit(36) and Current Limit(38) respectively
3. When the Operating Mode(11) is **Current-based Position Control Mode**, Position PID(80, 82, 84) and PWM Limit(36) values will be reset.

Note that the changed value of Position PID(80, 82, 84) and PWM Limit(36) can be read via the Control Table.

**NOTE**: PWM stands for **Pulse Width Modulation** that modulates PWM Duty to control motors. It changes pulse width to control average supply voltage to the motor, and this technique is widely used in the motor control field.

1. PWM Control Mode is similar to the Wheel Mode of AX and RX series.
2. Input Goal PWM(100) value to control supply voltage for DYNAMIXEL in **PWM Control Mode**.

**NOTE**: Present Position(132) represents a 4 byte continuous range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 when Torque is turned off regardless of Operating Mode(11).
However, Present Position(132) will be reset to an absolute position value within one full rotation in the following cases:

1. When the Operating Mode(11) is changed to **Position Control Mode**.
2. When torque is turned on in **Position Control Mode**.
3. When the actuator is turned on or when rebooted using a Reboot Instruction.

Note that a Present Position(132) value that has been reset to the absolute value within a single rotation will still be affected by the configured Homing Offset(20) value.

## Secondary(Shadow) ID(12)

The Secondary(Shadow) ID(12) assigns a secondary ID to the DYNAMIXEL.
The Secondary ID(12) can be shared to group between DYNAMIXELs and to synchronize their movement, unlike ID(7) which must be unique and not be overlapped to use.
Be aware of differences between the Secondary ID(12) and ID(7) by reading the following.

- Under the same Secondary ID(12), multiple DYNAMIXELs can be grouped.
- The ID(7) has a greater priority than the Secondary ID(12). If the data of Secondary ID(12) and ID(7) are set as same, the ID(7) will be applied at the top priority.
- The EEPROM area of the Control Table cannot be modified using Secondary ID(12).
- The RAM area can be modified using the Secondary ID(12).
- If Instruction Packet ID is the same as the Secondary ID(12), the Status Packet will not be returned.
- If the value of the Secondary ID(12) is 253 or higher, the Secondary ID function will be deactivated.

| Values | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 ~ 252 | Activate Secondary ID function |
| 253 ~ 255 | Deactivate Secondary ID function, Default value '255' |

### Secondary ID(12) Example

As mentioned, the Secondary ID(12) can be assigned with the same values unlike the ID(7).
See the following Secondary ID(12) example to understand the address properly. Note that The assigned ID(7) on each DYNAMIXELs is '1', '2', '3', '4' or '5' and they are not overlapped to be assigned.

1. Set Secondary ID of five DYNAMIXELs (Assigned ID(7) of each is '1','2','3','4' or '5', not overlapped) to '5'.
2. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID(7) = 1, LED(65) = 1).
3. The DYNAMIXEL with ID '1' turns on its LED by the Instruction Packet, and Status Packet will be returned.
4. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID(7) = 5, LED(65) = 1).
5. All DYNAMIXELs turns on their LED, but Status Packet of ID '5' will be returned only.
6. Set the Secondary ID of all DYNAMIXELs to '100'.
7. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID(7) = 100, LED(65) = 0).
8. All DYNAMIXELs turns off their LED. As no DYNAMIXEL uses ID 100, but uses the same Secondary ID, the Status Packet will not be returned.

## Protocol Type(13)

DYNAMIXEL protocol type (either DYNAMIXEL Protocol 1.0 or 2.0) can be selected using Protocol Type(13).

It is recommended to use an identical protocol type for multiple DYNAMIXEL.

| Value | Description | Compatible DYNAMIXEL |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | DYNAMIXEL Protocol 1.0 | AX Series, DX Series, RX Series, EX Series, MX Series with Firmware below v39 |
| 2(default) | DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0 | MX-28/64/106 with Firmware v39 or above, X Series, PRO Series |

**WARNING**: To modify the data of Protocol Type(13), use the DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0 as R+ Manager 2.0 is not compatible with the Protocol 1.0 products.

**NOTE**: The protocol 2.0 is more stable and safety for use than Protocol 1.0. Accessing some of the Control Table area might be denied if protocol 1.0 is selected. This manual complies with protocol 2.0.

## Homing Offset(20)

The Home Offset(20) adjusts the home position. The offset value is added to the Present Position(132).

**Present Position(132) = Actual Position + Homing Offset(20)**

| Unit | Value Range |
|------|-------------|
| about 0.088 [°] | -1,044,479 ~ 1,044,479<br/>(-255 ~ 255[rev]) |

**NOTE**: In case of the Position Control Mode(Joint Mode) that rotates less than 360 degrees, any invalid Homing Offset(20) values will be ignored(valid range : -1,024 ~ 1,024).

**WARNING**: Even if Drive Mode(10) is set to the Reverse Mode, the sign of Homing Offset(20) value is not reversed.

## Moving Threshold(24)

The Moving Threshold(24) determines whether the DYNAMIXEL is in motion or not.
When the absolute value of Present Velocity(128) is greater than the Moving Threshold(24), Moving(122) is set to '1'. Otherwise it is cleared to '0'.

| Unit | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| about 0.229 rpm | 0 ~ 1,023 | All velocity related Data uses the same unit |

## Temperature Limit(31)

The Temperature Limit(31) limits operating temperature of the DYNAMIXEL.

When the Present Temperature(146) exceeds the Temperature Limit(31), the Overheating Error Bit(Bit 2) of Hardware Error Status(70) is set to '1'. If Overheating Error Bit(Bit 2) is configured in Shutdown(63), Torque Enable(64) is cleared to '0' and the motor output becomes 0 [%].

| Unit | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| about 1 [°C] | 0 ~ 100 | Default value '80'(80[°C]) |

**CAUTION**: Do not set the temperature lower/higher than the default value. When the temperature of DYNAMIXEL rises above the configured Temperature Limit(31), the actuator will be shut down to protect the device.

## Max/Min Voltage Limit(32, 34)

These values limit maximum and minimum operating voltages.
When Present Input Voltage(144) exceeds the range of Max Voltage Limit(32) and Min Voltage Limit(34), the Input Voltage Error Bit(Bit 0) of Hardware Error Status(70) is set to '1'.
If Input Voltage Error Bit(Bit 0) is configured in Shutdown(63), Torque Enable(64) is cleared to '0' and the motor output becomes 0 [%].

| Unit | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| about 0.1 [V] | Min Voltage Limit(34): 50 ~ Max Voltage Limit(32)<br/>Max Voltage Limit(32): Min Voltage Limit(34) ~ 160 | Default values<br/>Min Voltage Limit(34) : 95 (9.5[V])<br/>Max Voltage Limit(32) : 160 (16.0[V]) |

**NOTE**: If Present Input Voltage(144) exceeds either Max Voltage Limit(32) or Min Voltage Limit(34), the Input Voltage Error Bit in Hardware Error Status(70) is set to '1'.

## PWM Limit(36)

This value limits PWM value of Goal PWM(100).
Goal PWM(100) cannot be configured with any values exceeding PWM Limit(36).

| Unit | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| about 0.113 [%] | 0 ~ 885 | Default value '885' (100[%])<br/>PWM Limit(36) = 100 |

**NOTE**: PWM is the abbreviation for Pulse Width Modulation that modulates PWM Duty to control motors. It changes pulse width to control average supply voltage to the motor, and this technique is widely used in the motor control field.
1 [%] of PWM corresponds to about 0.11 [V] when the input voltage is 11.1 [V] (rated voltage).

## Current Limit(38)

This value limits current of Goal Current(102).
Goal Current(102) cannot be configured with any values exceeding Current Limit(38).

| Unit | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| about 2.69 [mA] | 0 ~ 1,941 | Default value '1,941' (about 5,225[mA]) |

**NOTE**: Current Control Mode only uses the current limit value. Consider that the current limit value configuration WILL affect position and velocity control modes.

## Acceleration Limit(40)

This value limits Goal Acceleration of Profile Acceleration(108).
Profile Acceleration(108) cannot be configured with any values exceeding Acceleration Limit(40).
